# RockPaperScissors
Good and proper object-oriented programming (the beginnings of it, at least).
Present in this repository is a Game.java driver class, which handles the game's setup, taking in user inputs, and ultimately
managing all things that relevant to the user. Also present is the RockPaperScissors.java class, heavily relied upon in the
driver class for management of the game's actual machinations.
Also making an appearance is use of Switch Case statements, Try Catch statements, and a smooth user experience.
